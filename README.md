# cogtom_transfer_learning
This repo contains the codes and analyses for the **COGTOM TRANSFER LEARNING** project. 

Manuscript: <a href="https://github.com/CSNLWigner/cogtom_transfer_learning/edit/main/README.md"> Identifying transfer learning in the reshaping of inductive biases. </a>


## Data

Experimental data: stimuli and measured RTs are in elarasztas_dataset.zip. 

## Scripts for the analyses

#### LEARNING CURVES, AND LEARNING STRENGTH ANALYSES

(Training and transfer pahse)

- CT = GT+Markov, LS on D1 vs. D9.ipynb
- CT, Markov, GT on D1, D8.ipynb
- Learning curves (111, 119), LS on transfer vs. LS on training.ipynb
- Learning strength and D8 model performances.ipynb

#### ACROSS SESSIONS ANALYSES
(Training and transfer pahse)

- Across sessions - crossover plot (111, 119).ipynb
